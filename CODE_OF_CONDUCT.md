# Code of Conduct — Event Manager

Welcome! Event Manager is an open and inclusive full-stack event management platform built with the MERN stack. To keep our community healthy and welcoming, we've adopted this Code of Conduct. By participating in this project (issues, pull requests, discussions, chat, or events), you agree to follow these guidelines.

## 1. Our Standards

We expect contributors and maintainers to:

* Be respectful and courteous to others.
* Use inclusive language and avoid derogatory or exclusionary remarks.
* Consider diverse perspectives and experiences.
* Give and receive feedback constructively.
* Assume good faith: many issues are unintentional and come from people learning.

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

* Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind (based on age, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, religion, nationality, or any other protected class).
* Hateful or violent language, slurs, or insults.
* Sustained disruption of project collaboration (e.g., repeated off-topic trolling, doxxing, spamming).
* Publishing someone else's private information without consent.
* Threats, stalking, or other invasions of privacy.

## 2. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces including but not limited to:

* GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, comments)
* Project discussions and chats (Discord/Slack/community channels if used)
* Community calls, events, and presentations
* Any other public or private communication channels maintained by Event Manager
* Social media interactions related to the project

## 3. Reporting & Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to report it.

```

### What to Expect

* Reports are acknowledged within a reasonable timeframe (usually within 72 hours).
* The conduct team will investigate confidentially and fairly.
* Outcomes may include a warning, temporary suspension from project channels, removal of content, or a permanent ban depending on severity.
* We will respect privacy and only disclose details on a need-to-know basis.

## 4. Moderation & Consequences

The project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this code. If a maintainer is accused, the report will be handled by a neutral third party (another maintainer or trusted community member not involved in the incident).

### Consequences May Include

* **First Violation:** Private warning and mandated corrective action.
* **Second Violation:** Temporary suspension from contributing (typically 7-30 days).
* **Severe or Repeated Violations:** 
  - Removal of content or blocking from communication channels.
  - Permanent ban from the project.
  - Referral to GitHub support or platform operators for extreme cases.

### Appeal Process

If you believe a moderation decision was made in error, you may appeal by:
1. Sending a detailed explanation to deven81281256@gmail.com
2. Appeals will be reviewed within 7 days
3. The decision of the appeal review is final

## 5. Attribution & License

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the **Contributor Covenant** (version 2.0) and customized for Event Manager. You may reuse or adapt this file for other projects under the MIT License.

## 6. FAQ & Examples

**Q: "I received a harsh code review — is that misconduct?"**
A: Constructive criticism delivered respectfully is allowed and encouraged; personal attacks or repeated public shaming are not. Focus on the code, not the person.

**Q: "What should I do if I'm unsure whether to report?"**
A: If you feel uncomfortable, report it. The conduct team will evaluate and treat the report sensitively. We'd rather review a questionable case than miss a serious issue.

**Q: "Can I report anonymously?"**
A: Yes, you can create a throwaway email account or ask a trusted community member to report on your behalf. However, providing contact information helps us follow up if we need clarification.

**Q: "What if the maintainer is the one behaving inappropriately?"**
A: We take this seriously. Please report to a trusted community member or create a public issue if you're comfortable doing so. We're committed to accountability at all levels.

**Q: "Is debate about technical decisions allowed?"**
A: Absolutely! Healthy technical debate is welcome. Just keep it professional, respectful, and focused on the merits of different approaches.
